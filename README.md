Here I will display some (not all) of my project files to showcase some code in php &amp; vue utilising the laravel framework.
I have omitted files that I did not write myself for example I used composer to require laravel/ui and installed the auth module but did not edit the code so I have omitted those files from this repository. I also emitted the ENV file for security reasons.
